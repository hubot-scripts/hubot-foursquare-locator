{"name":"Hubot Foursquare Locator","tagline":"Get last checkin of your bot's friends","body":"## How to Set Up the Bot User\r\n\r\n1. Register a Foursquare application to obtain your `FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID` and `FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET`\r\n2. Authenticate either your personal foursquare account or a purpose-specific user that acts as your bot\r\n3. Manually walk through the OAuth process to obtain a `FOURSQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (this can be tricky)\r\n\r\nWhen you have all three values, load them as environment variables for launching your Hubot. If you are installing via Heroku, you would enter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ heroku set:config FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid\r\n$ heroku set:config FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret\r\n$ heroku set:config FOURSQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=youraccesstoken\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using some other hosting/launcher, make sure the variables above are loaded in appropriately.\r\n\r\n## Adding Module to Your Hubot\r\n\r\nSee full instructions [here](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#npm-packages).\r\n\r\n1. `npm install hubot-foursquare-locator --save` (updates your `package.json` file)\r\n2. Open the `external-scripts.json` file in the root directory (you may need to create this file) and add an entry to the array (e.g. `[ 'hubot-foursquare-locator' ]`).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Get All Recent Checkins\r\n\r\n* `hubot foursquare`\r\n* `hubot where is everyone?`\r\n* A list of all recent checkins appears\r\n\r\n### Find Last Checkins\r\n\r\n* `hubot where is bob?`\r\n* Bob's last checkin (if a friend) appears\r\n* If there is more than one Bob in your friend list, you will see all of them\r\n\r\n### Map Usernames to Foursquare User IDs\r\n\r\n* Look up your foursquare numeric ID\r\n* `hubot foursquare me as 12345`\r\n* Your screen name is now mapped to a numeric ID so that `where is myusername?` works as well.\r\n* This works for mapping other room users as well (`hubot foursquare otherusername as 98765`)\r\n\r\n### Approve New Friends\r\n\r\n* Users add the bot as a friend\r\n* `hubot foursquare approve`\r\n* All pending friend requests are approved\r\n\r\n### List Friends\r\n\r\n* `hubot foursquare friends`\r\n* See a list of authenticated bot's friends\r\n\r\n### Get Registration Information\r\n\r\n* `hubot foursquare register`\r\n* Identifies the account that other users should add as a friend\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
